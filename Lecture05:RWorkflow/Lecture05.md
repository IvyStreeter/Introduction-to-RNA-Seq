Annotations are a hurdle for many gene expression studies
Two strategies to working with annotations are:
1. Work with an organism that has an annotation specific package. This will only apply to you if you work with human, mouse, or rat. For other organisms, you may find these annotations on Bioconductor
2. For other organisms, it may not be present in annotations package we are using (ensemble), but may be present in numerous other annotations, such as biomart

Annotations link the transcript identifier to the gene name.
