# Lecture notes
## Learning objectives
- Talk about the model.matrix() function
- Talk about how to set your pairwise comparisons using the contrast.matrix() function
- Use the limma package to identify differentially expressed genes
- Produce static and interactive volcano plots
- Use the isoformSwitchAnalyzeR package to carry out an analysis of differential transcript usage (DTU).

Gene level data may be more accurate than transcript data due to isoform calling and shared exons. 

It's important to note, that regardless of DGE, DTE, DTU, kallisto is a recommended aligner.

Most genes produce isoforms, ~6 on average per gene with ~3 having protein coding potential. Isoform switching can have different prognosis consequences for cancer patients.
